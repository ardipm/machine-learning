# Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects that cover various domains such as classification, clustering, regression, and recommendation systems. Each project folder includes specific datasets, code implementations, and models that address different machine learning problems.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Credit Repayment Classification
Predict the likelihood of credit repayment using classification algorithms. The project focuses on feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

### 2. Credit Segmentation Clustering
This project involves clustering customers based on their credit-related features to identify different segments using algorithms like K-Means.

### 3. Financial Instrument Recommendation by Classification
A recommendation system built using classification techniques to suggest financial instruments based on user profiles.

### 4. Ride Share Regression
Analyze ride-share data and build regression models to predict variables such as trip duration or fare.

### 5. Weather Type Classification
Classify weather types using various classification models, aimed at improving the accuracy of weather predictions.

## Usage

Explore the individual project folders to understand the datasets and code implementations. You can run the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) provided in each folder to replicate the results or modify the code for further experimentation.
