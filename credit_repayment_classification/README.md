## Project Description
This project aims to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment next month using historical data. The dataset was obtained from BigQuery's `credit_card_default` database. Key objectives include balancing precision and recall through the F1 score, analyzing customer behavior, and optimizing a Logistic Regression model to reach the target performance. Challenges faced included moderate initial F1 scores, leading to further feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.
