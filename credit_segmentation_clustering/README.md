## Project Description

This project aims to analyze the behavior of credit card users and segment them to identify and manage risks for the credit card issuer (the bank). The dataset utilized for this analysis is sourced from the BigQuery public dataset.

### Objectives:
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Identify and categorize customers into distinct segments based on their financial behavior and spending patterns.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate and classify the credit risk associated with each customer segment.
3. **Strategic Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights to improve risk management, develop targeted financial products, and enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Data Analysis and Modeling:
1. **Data Source:** Credit card dataset retrieved from BigQuery.
2. **Questions Explored:**
   - How frequently do customers update their balance?
   - What are the different patterns of credit usage and payment behavior?
   - How can customers be categorized based on their financial behavior?
3. **Hypotheses Tested:**
   - Customers with higher balances and frequent transactions have distinct risk profiles compared to those with lower balances.
   - Spending patterns and credit usage significantly impact credit risk.
4. **Analysis Work:**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships.
   - Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers into distinct profiles.
   - Used risk assessment models to evaluate and categorize credit risk for each segment.
5. **Challenges:**
   - Ensuring accurate segmentation amidst diverse financial behaviors.
   - Managing data quality and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent entries.

## Getting Started

To run this analysis, follow these steps:
