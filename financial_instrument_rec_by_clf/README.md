# Personalized Finance Recommendation System

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to develop a personalized finance recommendation system that provides tailored investment advice based on an individual's financial data, risk tolerance, and goals. The system aims to help users make smarter and more informed investment decisions, ultimately leading to better financial outcomes aligned with their long-term goals.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Clustering Analysis
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn
* TensorFlow/Keras
* Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Description

This project analyzes investment behavior among young millennials, utilizing the 5W1H approach to understand their preferences, decision-making processes, and risk profiles. The system employs clustering techniques to group respondents based on their characteristics and risk profiles and leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to generate personalized investment product recommendations.

### Main Objectives:
1. **Understanding Investment Behavior**: Analyze investment preferences, decision-making factors, and risk tolerance among young millennials.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform demographic analysis, investment preference analysis, and risk tolerance assessment before and after clustering.
3. **Clustering**: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Elbow Method, and Silhouette Scores to identify optimal clusters.
4. **Recommendation System**: Develop an ANN model to provide personalized investment advice based on clustered profiles.

### Project Challenges:
- Ensuring data quality and preparation for analysis.
- Balancing model complexity and accuracy in the ANN model.
- Determining the optimal number of clusters to represent respondent groups accurately.

## Needs of this project

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Clustering analysis expertise
- Machine learning modeling (especially ANN)
- Documentation and reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-finance-recommendation.git
    cd personalized-finance-recommendation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
